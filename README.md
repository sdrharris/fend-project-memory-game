How to play
Click on the tiles to turn them over. 
If you get a match the tiles will stay faced up
If you don't get a match the tiles will turn back over.
The goal is to match two tiles of the same type, until all of the tiles are matched. Try matching as many tiles as possible in a minimum amount of moves. There are 16 cards with 8 matching pairs. Remember your cards! You can also keep track of your progress in the score panel.
